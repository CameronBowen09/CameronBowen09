I am currently studying at Code Collage in SA. I am a Junior Software Engineer. I have studied Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL and PHP. 
I have completed seven Software Engineering courses. I am very keen to work in the industry and be integrated into a dynamic team within a Company 
where I can  grow and contribute as I gain hands on experience and continue to up-skill my knowledge to a more advanced level. I am a 23 year old 
looking to make their mark on the software engineering and game development world.
